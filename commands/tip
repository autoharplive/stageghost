There are over 100 lo-fi ANSI animations, and elite members can add their own.
The DronesoundTV lo-fi ANSI text animations were created because the project had no graphic capabilities.
The lo-fi ANSI text animations are sort of a signature of DronesoundTV. We are very fond of them.
There are over 100 tracks in the MIX random onboard playlist.
The onboard playlist is mostly lo-fi beats genre, but also classical, jazz, folk, and experimental.
MIX random is the easiest way to add some music. Type MIX random.
Advanced users can play any download enabled track on SoundCloud. Type MIX.

The COMMANDS command lists the latest available commands. It is always up-to-date.
This bot allows easy user add-ons, so the COMMANDS list may change often.
The best commands are reserved for subscribers. You just gotta SUB, man!
There are even secret commands...you just gotta ask around.
With the DRONE and MIX commands, you are basically in total control of the sound here.
With the THEME, BG, and COLOR commands, you control the entire display.
Themes are easily made, and advanced users will soon make their own.
