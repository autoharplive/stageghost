An example 'Door Game' for StageGhost
"Doors" - the world of procedurally-generated doors

As an example, it demonstrates the 'door game' model:
  Keeps and manages own data files
  World is largely stateless
  Player state part of player data, not world data
  Inter-player messaging takes place in player data

The game itself:
Players "navigate a robot by remote" N, S, E, W through a grid of 4-sided rooms with doors on each side. Doors must be "unlocked" by de-scrambling a word, after which the player can pass through the door automatically. Player system-wide .score files are credited or debited appropriately. Some rooms are inhabited by an NPC, following their own schedule.

Rudimentary procedural generation is used to provide unique but stateless properties for everything, including room names, door puzzles, and all NPC characteristics.
